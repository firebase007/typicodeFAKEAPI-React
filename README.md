# typicodeAPI meets a React JS front-end

Playing with the Typicode API using ReactJS as the Front-end library

## Starting/Running the Application?

- git clone the repo on your local machine `git clone "https://github.com/firebase007/typicodeFAKEAPI-React"`
- cd in the directory `cd [directory-name]`
- run `npm install` from your terminal/command prompt
- run `npm start`
- Navigate to the url on the browser using this link, ```(https://www.localhost:3000)```

## RoadMap

- Refactor all components
- Look out for perfomance bottlenecks
- Check for scalability concerns
- Overhaul the entire UI as the current one is just for     testing out purposes
- Add support for webpack
- Add support for eslint and prettier code
- Use styled components for the component styling
- Use react boostrap for the cards and for displaying the list items
- Host on Heroku

## Note

Check out the typicode API at this link [http://wwww.jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](http://wwww.jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

To see a list of users to login with, check out this API URI for the username here, [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

Other resources can be found on this link here,[http://wwww.jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](http://wwww.jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) as the case maybe.

## Case Study

There is this large company with a website where posts of all company employees can be displayed and the public/customers can leave comments on the posts. The company wants more employees to publish post here, therefore they need you to
build an application specific for the employees of the company, that helps them to easily publish posts to the system and review their customer comments.

## User Stories for a company employee

As an employee, I want to be able to login very easily only with my username to get access to my private space. (no password needed). Typing in my username  each time could get in my way to be able to create posts fast on the fly, so it
would be great if the application remembers my username and logs me in my account automatically if I revisit the application with the same browser/computer again. To be save to use the application on my colleges computer as well I need a logout mechanism to prevent other people of using my account to login. After login, I want to see my personal user profile data, like name, email-address etc. somewhere on the screen,to be sure I am accessing my private space of the app and I can identify with it. In my space I want to be able to see all my Posts from the past in a Listview with the total count of my posts so I have a feeling I am making progress. At each post item in my list I need to see the number of comments related to it. This is very important to me to have a better understanding about what kind of topics people are interested in. With a “show comments” button I want to be able to read all related comments to a post within the list. A comment item should show me the body text, name and
email of the commenting user so I can get in touch with them with one click and give them feedback on their comment. (Directly copied from the trial task given to me by Dreamlines)

## Contributions

Contributions are highly welcome, however, please ensure to follow the guidelines and roadmap.Lets how this goes, maybe we could write a tutorial about this and open source everything just for those just starting out to learn how to play around with APIs and React JS.

## Credits

Special thanks to ```Dreamlines``` for giving me this opportunity and for the open source API by ```Typicode```
